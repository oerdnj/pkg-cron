 .SH NAME
 cron \- daemon to execute scheduled commands (Vixie Cron)
 .SH SYNOPSIS
 cron
+.RB [ -f ]
+.RB [ -l ]
+.RB [ -L
+.IR loglevel ]
 .SH DESCRIPTION
-.I Cron
-should be started from /etc/rc or /etc/rc.local.  It will return immediately,
-so you don't need to start it with '&'.
-.PP
-.I Cron
-searches /var/cron/tabs for crontab files which are named after accounts in
-/etc/passwd; crontabs found are loaded into memory.
-.I Cron
-also searches for /etc/crontab which is in a different format (see
-.IR crontab(5)).
-.I Cron
-then wakes up every minute, examining all stored crontabs, checking each
-command to see if it should be run in the current minute.  When executing
-commands, any output is mailed to the owner of the crontab (or to the user
-named in the MAILTO environment variable in the crontab, if such exists).
+.I cron
+is started automatically from /etc/init.d on entering multi-user
+runlevels.
+.SH OPTIONS
+.TP 8
+.B -f
+Stay in foreground mode, don't daemonize.
+.TP
+.B -l
+Enable LSB compliant names for /etc/cron.d files
+.TP
+.B -L loglevel
+Sets the loglevel for cron. The standard logging level (1) will log 
+the start of all the cron jobs. A higher loglevel (2) will cause
+cron to log also the end of all cronjobs, which can be useful to
+audit the behaviour of tasks run by cron. Logging will be disabled
+if the \fIloglevel\fR is set to zero (0).
+.SH NOTES
+.PP
+.I cron
+searches its spool area (/var/spool/cron/crontabs) for crontab
+files (which are named after accounts in
+/etc/passwd); crontabs found are loaded into memory.  Note that
+crontabs in this directory should not be accessed directly -
+the
+.I crontab
+command should be used to access and update them.
+
+.I cron
+also reads /etc/crontab, which is in a slightly different format (see
+.IR crontab(5) ). 
+Additionally,
+.I cron
+reads the files in /etc/cron.d: it
+treats the files in /etc/cron.d as in the same way as the /etc/crontab file (they
+follow the special format of that file, i.e. they include the 
+.I user
+field). However, they are independent of /etc/crontab: they do not, for 
+example, inherit environment variable settings from it. The intended purpose
+of this feature is to allow packages that require
+finer control of their scheduling than the /etc/cron.{daily,weekly,monthly} 
+directories to add a crontab file to /etc/cron.d. Such files
+should be named after the package that supplies them. Files must
+conform to the same naming convention as used by 
+.IR run-parts(8) :
+they
+must consist solely of upper- and lower-case letters, digits, underscores,
+and hyphens. If the 
+.B -l
+option is specified, then they must conform to the LSB namespace specification,
+exactly as in the
+.B --lsbsysinit
+option in 
+.IR run-parts .
+
+Like /etc/crontab, the files in the /etc/cron.d directory are
+monitored for changes. In general, the admin should not use /etc/cron.d/,
+but use the standard system crontab /etc/crontab.
+
+.I cron
+then wakes up every minute, examining all stored crontabs, checking
+each command to see if it should be run in the current minute.  When
+executing commands, any output is mailed to the owner of the crontab
+(or to the user named in the MAILTO environment variable in the
+crontab, if such exists).  The children copies of cron running these
+processes have their name coerced to uppercase, as will be seen in the
+syslog and ps output.

 changed.  Thus
 .I cron
 need not be restarted whenever a crontab file is modified.  Note that the
-.IR Crontab (1)
+.IR crontab (1)
 command updates the modtime of the spool directory whenever it changes a
 crontab.
+.PP
+Special considerations exist when the clock is changed by less than 3
+hours, for example at the beginning and end of daylight savings
+time. If the time has moved forwards, those jobs which would have
+run in the time that was skipped will be run soon after the change. 
+Conversely, if the time has moved backwards by less than 3 hours,
+those jobs that fall into the repeated time will not be re-run.
+.PP
+Only jobs that run at a particular time (not specified as
+@hourly, nor with '*' in the hour or minute specifier) are
+affected. Jobs which are specified with wildcards are run based on the
+new time immediately.
+.PP
+Clock changes of more than 3 hours are considered to be corrections to
+the clock, and the new time is used immediately.
+.PP
+.I cron

+controlled using the standard syslogd(8) facility.
