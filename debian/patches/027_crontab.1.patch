+The "out-of-the-box" behaviour for
+.I crontab -l
+is to display the three line "DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE" header 
+that is placed at the
+beginning of the crontab when it is installed. The problem is that
+it makes the sequence

+.PP
+non-idempotent -- you keep adding copies of the header. This causes
+pain to scripts that use sed to edit a crontab. Therefore, the default
+behaviour of the 
+.B -l
+option has been changed to not output such header. You may obtain the
+original behaviour by setting the environment variable 
+.B CRONTAB_NOHEADER
+to 'N', which will cause the
+.I crontab -l
+command to emit the extraneous header.

+.SH BUGS
+Although cron requires that each entry in a crontab end in a newline
+character, neither the crontab command nor the cron daemon will
+detect this error. Instead, the crontab will appear to load
+normally. However, the command will never run. The best choice is to
+ensure that your crontab has a blank line at the end.
